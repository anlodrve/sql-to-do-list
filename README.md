# To Do List

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This is a basic to-do list app created while learning the basics of jQuery and the full-stack flow of information from client to server to database and back. The goal was to have the ability of users to add a task, mark a task as complete, and delete a task, and have all of those changes be visually represented.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal.
5. Open your browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:5000/' (or whichever port your terminal says the application is running on)

## Usage
1. Users can view all of the tasks and whether they are completed or not. 
1. Users can add a task in the input form on the left side of the screen by inputting the name of the task, any relevant details, and the due date. 
1. Once submitted, the task will show up on the screen. 
1. If users have completed a task, they can click the checkbox. This will make all the text on the task be strikethrough, clearly marking it as completed. 
1. If the user wants to mark the task as incomplete again, they can click the checkbox again and the task will return to its original view.  
1. If a user wants to delete a task, they can click the red x in the corner of the task and it will be deleted.
